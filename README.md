This mobile app allows users to view a list of users retrieved from the API and go to a detailed page of a particular user by clicking on their card. The app is designed using React-Native, Axios, and Styled-Components technologies.

Users can easily browse a list of available users and view their detailed information on a separate page. Each user is presented as a card that displays their photo, first name and last name.

The application uses the Axios library to perform API queries and retrieve the list of users. The Styled-Components library is used to style the application.

Development of this mobile application with React-Native provides high performance and fast interface display on mobile devices. This project demonstrates the use of modern technologies for creating mobile applications, providing an easy and convenient way to view user information obtained from the API.
